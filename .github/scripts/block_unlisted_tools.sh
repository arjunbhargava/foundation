# Makes a CI job fail when its commands run a tool that mise.toml pins but the
# job's MISE_ENABLE_TOOLS leaves out. mise ignores such a tool, so without
# this the command would silently run whatever version the runner has.
#
# For each unlisted tool, this writes an executable with the tool's command
# name that prints an error naming the tool and the list to edit, then exits
# with status 127. It puts their directory first on the PATH of the job's
# later steps. Listed tools are unaffected, because mise puts their
# directories ahead of it when it runs a task.
#
# Run it in a CI job after .cursor/install.sh, which needs the real tools, for
# example `bash .github/scripts/block_unlisted_tools.sh`. It needs
# MISE_ENABLE_TOOLS, GITHUB_JOB, GITHUB_PATH, and RUNNER_TEMP, which GitHub
# Actions sets, except MISE_ENABLE_TOOLS, which the job sets.
